# Grosery_Project
 
This project has been created using JavaScript in which we can calculate our daily expenses. By entering the name of the product and its price and on which date it is purchased, we can see its total price and complete table and pdf. You can download it in excel,copy,csv format and to apply all these I have used javascript data table and to make it responsive I have used bootstrap-5 and I have also used some jquery.
